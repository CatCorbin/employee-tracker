## Usage

This project can be used by any company, big or small. It saves time and headache by creating a spreadsheet of all employees including their job title, department, and manager. This spreadsheet can be further used to look at specific departments or specific employees as well as their salaries. When an employee is promoted, that change can be made right through the command line interface to adjust the existing spreadsheet. If new departments or employees are added, it's simple to adjust the spreadsheet to reflect that.
